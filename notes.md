# offlineify

two use cases which we want to consider:

1. make the appcache easy to use.

2. make the appcache secure

## easy

The app works offline. when the code is updated,
the app updates in the background - it could poll
or whatever - then a notice is displayed to user:
*code updated refresh (Ctrl-Shift-R) to activate*
then you have the new code.

## secure
